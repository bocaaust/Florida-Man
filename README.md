# Florida Man: The Game
A Warioware-style iOS game that follows the adventures of Florida Man in an /r/cringepics-esque fashion.

##How to Play
This game is a set of different minigames, all based off of real Florida Man headlines. You are not given any instructions other than the headline provided to you. Have fun!

##How It's Made
This game is written in Codea, a powerful and easy to use version of Lua, as a project for one of RPI's monthly [Game Jam](http://gamedev.union.rpi.edu/game-jams/) events. We were given 24 hours to build a game from scratch, following the theme of Parody. Our game is a parody of the classic Warioware game as well as real-life crimes committed by the infamous Florida Man.
